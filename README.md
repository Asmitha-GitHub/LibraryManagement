# Library Management System 

This is a **frontend demo** of a Library Management System. It mimics the workflow of a real system with Login, Add Book, View Books, and Issue Book pages.  

## Project Overview

The Library Management System allows users to:

- Login to the system
- Add and manage books
- View available books
- Issue and return books
- Search books (demo)


This project is still under development; I am working on it make it more attractive and interactive.
